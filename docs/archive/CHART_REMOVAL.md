# ✅ TrendArc Score Chart Removed

## What Was Removed

**Removed:** `TrendArcScoreChart` component and its usage on the compare page

**Reason:** 
- Chart was confusing and redundant
- Only showed Google Trends data (already shown below)
- Reference lines were static (didn't change over time)
- Can't create true "TrendArc Score over time" because other sources (YouTube, TMDB, etc.) are point-in-time data, not time-series

---

## ✅ New Layout

**Before:**
1. TrendArc Verdict
2. TrendArc Score Chart (redundant)
3. Google Trends Chart
4. Multi-Source Breakdown

**After:**
1. TrendArc Verdict (shows combined score)
2. Google Trends Chart (shows search interest over time)
3. Multi-Source Breakdown (shows how score is calculated)

**Much cleaner and less confusing!** ✅

## 📊 What Users See Now

1. **TrendArc Verdict** - Combined multi-source score (the main result)
2. **Google Trends Chart** - Shows how search interest changes over time
3. **Multi-Source Breakdown** - Explains how the score is calculated

**Clear, simple, and makes sense!** ✅

## 🎯 Why This Is Better

- ✅ No confusion about duplicate data
- ✅ Clear distinction: Verdict = combined score, Chart = raw search data
- ✅ Simpler page layout
- ✅ Better user experience
