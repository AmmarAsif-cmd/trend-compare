## Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run the Migration

```bash
# If you have database access:
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Or apply manually when deploying:
# The migration file is in: prisma/migrations/20241207000000_add_blog_posts/migration.sql
```

### Step 2: Generate Your First Posts

```bash
# Generate 5 blog posts from your trending comparisons
npm run blog:generate

# Or with custom limit:
npx tsx scripts/generate-blog-posts.ts --limit 10
```

This will:
- Scan your database for popular comparisons
- Generate SEO-optimized blog posts using AI
- Save them as "pending_review" (not live yet)
- Take ~30 seconds for 5 posts

### Step 3: Review & Approve

```bash
# Start your dev server
npm run dev

# Open admin dashboard
http://localhost:3000/admin/blog
```

You'll see all generated posts. For each post:
1. Click "Review" to see full content
2. Edit title, excerpt, or content if needed
3. Click "✓ Approve"
4. Click "🚀 Publish Now"

### Step 4: View Your Blog

```bash
http://localhost:3000/blog
```

## How It Works

### 1. Generation Process

```
Trending Comparisons → AI Analysis → Blog Post Draft → Your Approval → Published
```

**What the AI generates:**
- Title (SEO-optimized, 60-70 chars)
- Excerpt (compelling summary, 150-160 chars)
- Content (800-1500 words in Markdown)
- Meta title & description
- Keywords & tags
- Category & read time

### 2. Content Types

The AI can generate 4 types of posts:

1. **Comparison Analysis** - "iPhone vs Android: Trend Insights"
2. **Trend Analysis** - "The Rise of AI Search Tools"
3. **Category Roundup** - "Top Tech Trends of 2024"
4. **Seasonal** - "Holiday Shopping Trends Analysis"

### 3. Approval Workflow

```
draft → pending_review → approved → published
```

- `pending_review`: Generated by AI, needs your review
- `approved`: You approved it, ready to publish
- `published`: Live on your blog
- `rejected`: Not suitable, deleted

---

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Generate posts
npm run blog:generate

# Run migration
npx prisma migrate deploy

# View database
npx prisma studio
```

## Cost Estimate

Using **Claude Haiku** (cheapest):
- **$0.002 per post** (~$0.10 for 50 posts)
- Much cheaper than hiring writers ($50-200/post)

Example monthly costs:
- 50 posts = $0.10/month
- 100 posts = $0.20/month
- 500 posts = $1.00/month

**You're generating content at 1000× lower cost than traditional writing.**

## Pro Tips

### 1. Edit Before Publishing
The AI is good but not perfect. Always:
- Check facts and dates
- Add your personal insights
- Fix any awkward phrasing
- Ensure brand voice consistency

### 2. Pick Your Best
Don't publish everything. Only approve:
- Posts with unique insights
- Topics with search volume
- Content you'd be proud to share

### 3. Batch Generate, Slow Publish
- Generate 20 posts at once
- Publish 2-3 per week
- Keeps your blog active without overwhelming readers

### 4. Track Performance
After 1 month:
- Which categories get most views?
- Which posts lead to comparison clicks?
- Which sources bring traffic?

Then generate MORE of what works.

## Troubleshooting

### "No posts generated"
**Cause**: No recent comparisons in database
**Fix**: Wait for users to create comparisons, or manually create seed data

### "AI generation failed"
**Cause**: Missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
**Fix**: Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### "Can't access admin dashboard"
**Cause**: Route not configured
**Fix**: Add authentication later. For now it's open.

### "Markdown not rendering"
**Cause**: react-markdown not installed
**Fix**: `npm install react-markdown` (already done)

---

## Security Note

**IMPORTANT**: The `/admin/blog` route is currently **not protected**.

Anyone can access it. Before deploying to production, add authentication:

```typescript
// app/admin/blog/page.tsx
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

export default async function AdminBlogDashboard() {
  // Add your auth check here
  const isAdmin = checkAuth(); // Your auth logic
  if (!isAdmin) redirect("/login");

  // Rest of code...
}
```

Or use environment variable password protection:

```typescript
const ADMIN_PASSWORD = process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD;
// Check password in middleware
```
