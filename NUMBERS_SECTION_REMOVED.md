# ✅ Numbers Section Removed

## What Was Removed

**Removed:** "The Numbers" section (`CompareStats` component)

**Reason:** 
- Confusing for users
- Redundant information (already shown in TrendArc Verdict)
- Too many numbers can overwhelm users

---

## ✅ What's Still There

The calculations (`totalSearches`, `aShare`, `bShare`) are still used internally for:
- Fallback verdict logic (when intelligent comparison fails)
- Structured data for SEO
- Internal calculations

**But the confusing display section is gone!** ✅
