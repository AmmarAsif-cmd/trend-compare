# 📝 Content Review: Homepage & About Page

## 🔍 **Current Content Analysis**

### **Homepage (Hero Section)** ✅ **Mostly Good**

**Current Headline:**
- "See What's Trending. Discover What's Next."

**Current Subhead:**
- "Your trend intelligence dashboard. Compare what's hot across movies, music, games, and products. Multi-source data, AI insights, zero complexity."

**✅ Strengths:**
- Clear value proposition
- Mentions multi-source data
- Mentions AI insights
- Mentions categories (movies, music, games, products)
- Professional tone

**⚠️ Minor Issues:**
- Could be slightly more specific about what makes it unique
- Could emphasize the "intelligence" aspect more

**Verdict:** ✅ **Good - Minor tweaks optional**

---

### **About Page** ❌ **Needs Update - Outdated!**

**Current Content Issues:**

1. **Only mentions Google Trends** ❌
   - Says: "We transform complex Google Trends data..."
   - **Reality:** You use 6+ sources (Google Trends, TMDB, Spotify, Steam, Best Buy, YouTube)

2. **Doesn't mention AI-powered insights** ❌
   - Missing the key differentiator

3. **Doesn't mention category detection** ❌
   - Missing smart category detection feature

4. **Doesn't mention TrendArc Score** ❌
   - Missing the unified scoring system

5. **Outdated description** ❌
   - "What We Do" section only talks about Google Trends
   - Doesn't reflect the multi-source intelligence platform

**Verdict:** ❌ **Needs significant update**

---

### **Brand Tagline** ⚠️ **Outdated**

**Current:** "Simple keyword comparisons with clean charts"

**Issue:** This doesn't reflect:
- Multi-source intelligence
- AI-powered insights
- Category-specific data
- TrendArc Score

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **Should update to match current features**

---

## 🎯 **Recommendations**

### **Priority 1: Update About Page** 🔴 **CRITICAL**
- Reflect multi-source intelligence (not just Google Trends)
- Mention AI-powered insights
- Mention category detection
- Mention TrendArc Score
- Update "What We Do" section

### **Priority 2: Update Brand Tagline** 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- Change from "Simple keyword comparisons" to something that reflects intelligence/AI

### **Priority 3: Enhance Homepage** 🟢 **OPTIONAL**
- Minor tweaks to emphasize intelligence
- Could add more specific benefits

---

## ✅ **What I'll Update**

1. ✅ **About Page** - Complete rewrite to reflect multi-source intelligence
2. ✅ **Brand Tagline** - Update to match current features
3. ⚠️ **Homepage** - Minor enhancement (optional)
